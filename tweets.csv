A report on ICICI BANK by Motilal OSWAL 
 
** What looks to be a picture perfect performance in one quarter only adds more colors in the ensuing quarter. Our conviction in the bank remains strong and we believe that the journey is likely to get even more exciting in the coming years. 
** Over the last couple of quarters, due to intense FII selling, the stock's absolute performance has been limited; however, with flawless execution it is only a matter of time that ICICI‚Äôs valuation will expand to its deserving multiple, thus generating supernormal returns for investors. 
** We estimate the bank to deliver a FY24 RoA/RoE of 2.1%/17.1% and reiterate our Buy rating with an SoTP-based TP of INR1,050 per share (2.8x FY24E ABV). ICICIBC remains our top pick in the sector. Bullish",Bullish

$RELIANCE.NSE,"$RELIANCE.NSE Q2 results were slightly better than estimates. The legacy O2C business did much of the heavy lifting whereas Jio and Retail posted satisfactory performance. Higher discounts on Russian oil boosted refining margins. Jio continued to add new users albeit at a slower pace. The retail business posted healthy growth driven by aggressive store expansion. Here are the key stats: üìä

Revenue: Rs 2.13 lakh cr; -2% QoQ (vs Est: Rs 2.2 lakh cr) 
EBITDA: Rs 38,440 cr; +9% QoQ (vs Est: Rs 36,800cr)
EBITDA Margin: 18.1% vs Est: 16.7%
Net Profit: Rs 19,299 cr; +22% QoQ (vs Est: Rs 16,400 cr)

Investors are bullish on the future growth prospects of all 3 biz. The O2C segment is likely to improve with the addition of new refining capacity + demand pickup in China. Similarly, steady free cash flow generation in the retail biz and tariff hikes outlook by Jio are key triggers, they added.

A thread üßµ

2/ Infra: 
The Indian infrastructure sector is made up of transportation, water and sanitation and urban infrastructure. They are essential for connecting people and driving business, making them the engines of growth and development.

3/ For example, imagine a Govt investing in infrastructure projects, it creates jobs and income for people, who in turn have more money to spend on other things, generating more jobs and income for other people in the process. This chain reaction is called the multiplier effect. 

4/ The GOI has been pouring massive investments to upgrade and modernize the country‚Äôs infrastructure. Last year, they announced that they will spend a whopping Rs 7.5 lakh crore to build new roads, homes, dams, and other projects. Bullish",Bullish

$RELIANCE.NSE,"$RELIANCE.NSE Seems like mota bhai is getting ready to take the leadership. The past 6 months, RIL has barely moved (+1%) vs $NIFTY50.NSE gaining nearly 18%. 

The main reason for this underperformance was the shock windfall tax on fuel exports imposed by the GOI back in July. As oil prices have cooled off, refining margins have shrunk sharply. Experts are optimistic that Govt may soon withdraw the hefty duties. PS - they did so in case of steel as well. 

If that were to happen, RIL‚Äôs refining margins may move up by $2 per barrel. This translates to a $1 billion gain on the EBITDA front, which is a massive W!!! 

Besides this, telecom and retail are also killing it. Jio continues to grow faster than industry as per latest TRAI data. Reliance Retail successfully launched its FMCG business under the ‚ÄúIndependence‚Äù brand last week.

Reliance is at a long term trendline.  
However, if you try to read the chart, it does not seems to show any signs of bullishness.  
IMO, retailers can get trap here, i see it going a bit more down, till 2240 zone.  
Reasons of saying so- 
1. Look at the 2 highlighted volume candles, it looks like someone is exiting in huge quantity. 
2. If it was suppose to bounce, it would have bounced straight away, without spending 10 days at support, may be its making base to fall, trapping the retailers. 
3. It has formed a double top pattern from 2800 zone.  
4. It is taking resistance from previous support area (see blue area). This area previously also worked as key level- see circled areas.  
5. If closes below 2360 on daily, we can see it coming in black area

2. Crude Oil price is declining globally after US announced to open its emergency reserve to tackle rising inflation. It is harming the coffers of oil companies. As major oil & petroleum companies in India have a large share in nifty index, market is falling.

3. Failure of RIL-Armaco deal which made $RELIANCE.NSE price fall by 4.4% yesterday. Reliance have ~20% index share.

The technical chart indicates that the stock has an attractive setup, and further upward momentum appears to be on the horizon. If the stock can make a decisive move above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) level of Rs 382, it would further improve the trend, and the next target levels of Rs 415-420 would come into view.

""A decling/flat share price  not only frustrates shareholders but can prove disastrous for senior executives either locked into/granted ESOPs at higher than market prices which may result in attrition."" - Hemindra Hazari

Key Points:
* When stocks languish, or spiral downwards, it is not just shareholders whose wealth erodes. Senior executives, also suffer, as much of their personal wealth may be tied up in ESOPs. 
* Few HDFC Bank ESOPs  may be of concern to executives while many ESOPs of RBL Bank and Bandhan Bank are under water

* Aided by low credit costs, HDFCB continues to invest in expanding its geographical and digital distribution to deepen its penetration.

""An investment in HDFCB's stock has potential to generate 21%+ IRR over the next 3Y. While QoQ loan growth was somewhat muted, HDFCB's long-term potential remains strong."" - Ankit Agrawal, CFA (Yellowstone Equity)

Key Points:
* HDFC Bank (HDFCB IN) continues to focus on growing its offline distribution network and added 684 new branches in Q3FY23, taking the total to 7183.
* It is also focusing on niche under-penetrated segments like Gold Loans and Wealth Management. Its Payment Acceptance Points network has also seen rapid growth.
* QoQ loan growth was somewhat muted, largely due to underwhelming growth on the corporate side as pricing in the marketplace is not as remunerative due to elevated competition.

""HDFCB's stock has been under pressure over the past 6M due to narrative bias. However, the fundamentals remain sound. Current valuations offer the opportunity to generate 22%+ CAGR over the next 5Y."" - Ankit Agrawal, CFA (Yellowstone Equity)

Key Points:
* While HDFC Bank (""HDFCB"") is doing all the right things (distribution expansion, digital infrastructure revamp) from a long-term perspective, it also has near-term growth triggers led by its retail book.  
* Excluding auto sector and two-wheeler loans, HDFCB's retail book grew 25% YoY in Q1FY23. As the supply chain disruptions recede, HDFCB's retail book growth could surprise on the upside.
* HDFC Bank (HDFCB IN) is also making decent progress in its digitization upgrades which should further bolster the growth and productivity.

""TCS reported weaker than expected growth and margins in Q4FY23. Demand environment saw some slowdown led by the banking crisis in North America."" - Ankit Agrawal, CFA (Yellowstone Equity)

Key Points:
* TCS reported weaker than expected growth and margins. YoY growth in constant currency (CC) terms came in at just 10.7%. Operating Margin (OPM) came in at 24.1% vs 25% expected.
* North America in particular has seen some demand slowdown, largely due to deferment of discretionary projects and delayed decision making. Europe is improving as energy crisis is receding.
* Looking forward, Europe, in particular UK, is likely to lead the growth. North America may also come back as the banking crisis there seems to have been contained.

""TCS reported decent Q2FY23 earnings. The demand and margin outlook is also resilient despite recessionary fears in US and Europe. However, the stock is trading close to the fair valuation."" - Ankit Agrawal, CFA (Yellowstone Equity)

Key Points:
* Demand environment remains robust despite recessionary fears in US and Europe. Demand is being driven by structural factors like shift in the business model towards enterprise-wide digital transformation.
* One of the biggest headwinds - attrition - has now peaked and is trending downwards. Job market has cooled off and salaries of new hires have become reasonable.
* While the demand outlook and margin guidance is resilient, we estimate that the current valuations are fairly pricing the optimism. Projected IRRs are likely to be subdued from here on.

Rs1.5trn remain to be awarded over next 2-3 years (excluding those awarded in Mar‚Äô23).  
 
Based on the recent contracts awarded by MoD and the existing pipeline, we believe BEL (BUY; TP: Rs125) is likely to be the primary beneficiary (among our 
covered companies) as its healthy orderbook would complement execution across the three services.  
 
Besides, we see opportunities for BDL (BUY; TP: Rs1,175) as the government‚Äôs focus on missile systems would directly benefit the company. That said, we find the outlook for MDSL (SELL; TP: Rs600) nebulous as there is no clarity on repeat orders for submarines and destroyers Bullish",Bullish

$NIFTY50.NSE,"This is the weekly chart of $NIFTY50.NSE futures. 
 
The price may just have made a fresh lower high last week. Three reasons why I think so: 
 
1) The price appears to have taken resistance at the falling trendline. 
 
2) It opened below previous week's close and is now set to close below the previous week's open with a no lower wick so far, a small upper wick and a sufficiently large bearish candle. 
 
3) The price is reverting from the 61.8 Fib retracement from the previous swing high to swing low. 
 
If bears take hold again, we might see a retest of 17k - 16900. Reversal from there might suggest a broad trading range between 18400 and 17000. A break below might confirm continuation of the downtrend. Bearish",Bearish

Apart from price momentum, we look at earnings momentum as well (upgrade/ downgrade) and if the stock underperforms in terms of price and undergoes severe earnings downgrade (> 10%) as well then the stock is removed from the list irrespective of meeting the growth and valuation criteria.

Nifty 50  
Positional View 
On 16th March, shared that BULLS can try to take the price above, but mere a pull back. IT HAPPENED EXACTLY SAME.  
Price got rejection TWICE from level provided on 16th Mar i.e. 17200.  
 
Now at 17200, you can see some patterns. Some may call it Double top, etc. But for me its DEPLETION of buying pressure(circled). 17200, has proved itself to be immediate next major resistance. One should not expected a positive outcome (NO CE), till it does not crosses 17200 convincingly.  
 
Any formation of a negative pattern aka rejection before 17200 aka Lower High formation can trigger selling pressure. The more the price nearer to 17200, the better the risk reward gets for PE entries.  
 
Market has formed a broad range of 400 points between 16800 -17200, with a negative bias, till 17200 is not taken. These levels will be place to take counter trades. Bearish",Bearish

Bottomline: 
Nifty50 bounced back from the lower boundary of the Keltner channel. All the indicators and oscillators show further weakness. A break of yesterday's low of 17353.40 will take Nifty50 down to its probable final leg of a 3-wave decline from the top of 18887.60 for the projected target of 17090, where wave W will equal to wave Y.

Bottomline: 
Nifty50 may extend its decline further, with most of the Indicators and Oscillators in charts exhibiting  
further weakness with the supports near the 17280 and 17090 regions. In the past two sessions, retail  
investors have surprisingly increased their Bullish bet in Indices, in the Derivatives Segment whereas  
The FII and the PRO have increased their bearish position. The SEBI report published a few days back  
shows that almost 90% of Retail lose money in Derivatives, so the probability of Indices remaining  
bearish until the positions are squared up remains high.

$RELIANCE.NSE,"$RELIANCE.NSE Seems like mota bhai is getting ready to take the leadership. The past 6 months, RIL has barely moved (+1%) vs $NIFTY50.NSE gaining nearly 18%. 

The main reason for this underperformance was the shock windfall tax on fuel exports imposed by the GOI back in July. As oil prices have cooled off, refining margins have shrunk sharply. Experts are optimistic that Govt may soon withdraw the hefty duties. PS - they did so in case of steel as well. 

If that were to happen, RIL‚Äôs refining margins may move up by $2 per barrel. This translates to a $1 billion gain on the EBITDA front, which is a massive W!!! 

Besides this, telecom and retail are also killing it. Jio continues to grow faster than industry as per latest TRAI data. Reliance Retail successfully launched its FMCG business under the ‚ÄúIndependence‚Äù brand last week.

$NIFTY50.NSE,"OI Analysis: 
Today, In $NIFTY50.NSE Future OI lose of 0.8% with 0.29% gain in price and $NIFTY50.NSE consolidating in range with bullish bias.  We will come to know this OI gain is for selling or false one after seeing the follow up data for next day. 
 
In $NIFTYBANK.NSE, data slight varying to nifty data. $NIFTYBANK.NSE OI Gain of 13.69% with 1.07% gain in price and today trending market from initial tick. We have to clearly observe market data and price action for big move. Bullish",Bullish
$NIFTY50.NSE,"$NIFTY50.NSE Oil prices have fallen sharply from US$95/bbl seen in the first week of November to 
~US$79/bbl. The decline in crude prices was on account of a number of reasons, from weak demand in China (its PMI fell to a seven-month low of 48), the EU price 
cap on Russian oil, to uncertainty on the direction of Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hike.  
 
A rise in Covid-19 cases in China led to stringent restrictions in the country although they have started relaxing these restrictions to a certain limit. The EU and G7 nations have agreed on a price cap of US$60/bbl for seaborne Russian oil.  
 
The recent release of strong services data in the US raised concerns that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates more aggressively. Bullish",Bullish
$NIFTY50.NSE,"$NIFTY50.NSE $NIFTYMETAL.NSE Led by steep increase in prices of key commodities like steel, aluminium, polymers, rare earth metals, etc., auto OEMs saw gross margin erosion of ~400-500bps on an average from H1FY22 levels, impacting EBITDAM in turn.  
 
With steel alloy prices declining with a lag over auto grade steel prices along with impact of a weaker local currency, the impact of declining raw material prices on gross margins got delayed.  
 
Companies took price hikes even in Q3 to protect margins, hence we expect gross margin improvement to expedite from Q3 itself. Auto grade steel price contracts declined by 7% in Q3 over Q2. This, along with the recent decline in crude oil prices (pushing polymer component prices down), should bode well for EBITDAM in the auto OEM space Q4FY23E onwards, with operating leverage being favorable for manufacturers. Bullish",Bullish
$NIFTY50.NSE,"$NIFTY50.NSE $NIFTYAUTO.NSE Strong retails and moderate wholesales in Nov‚Äô22 imply continued destocking, paving the way for better wholesales from Q4 onward: Though retails in Nov‚Äô22 for 2W / PV / tractors were up YoY by 24% / 21% / 62%, wholesale growth in general was much lower, similar to the trajectory followed by the industry in Oct‚Äô22. 
 
With PV / 2W retails being up 10% / 70% in Nov‚Äô22 vs Q2 monthly average levels, wholesales in general are below pre-festive numbers, suggesting continued 
destocking amidst gradual revival in rural demand.  
 
We expect this divergence between retail and wholesale numbers to end by Dec‚Äô22 (manufacturing year-end), implying strong wholesales in Q4, aided by limited catalysts for TCO increase. Bullish",Bullish
$NIFTY50.NSE,"$NIFTY50.NSE Over the next 12 months, inflation is expected to remain higher than the 4% target. System liquidity remains in surplus with average daily absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) of | 1.6 lakh crore in November 2022.  
 
Since then, it has gone up to | 2.6 lakh crore as on December 5. The overall monetary and liquidity conditions remain accommodative. Bullish",Bullish
$NIFTY50.NSE,"$NIFTY50.NSE The RBI MPC was of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break core inflation 
persistence and contain second round effects. These actions are expected to strengthen the medium-term growth prospects of the Indian economy. 
 
Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points to 6.25% and remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation, while supporting growth.  
 
Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 6.00% with the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate at 6.50% Bullish",Bullish

Around 80% of Nifty constituents advanced this week while the top gainers were HDFC Life and Apollo Hospital. Nifty PSU Bank Index was the top sectoral gainer this week up 5% and Nifty IT continued its 4th consecutive positive streak.

üéØ The bulls were in total control triggered by a drop in crude prices, a falling dollar index, declining bond yields, and FII buying.

For now strategy remains the same of holding existing longs with stop loss 18250 and targets of 18500-18550. No fresh positions until we move out of channel. Bullish",Bullish

Key Points:
* We see 4 potential adds, 1 close add and 1 potential delete for the FTSE All-World/All-Cap indices at the upcoming QIR that will be implemented at close on 16 December.
* The largest impact will be the passive selling on Golden Agri Resources (GGR SP) due to a nationality change from Singapore to Ineligible.
* There is a big lock-up expiry on Delhivery where US$2.89bn of shares will be free for trading on 21 November - that is significantly larger than the potential passive buying.

$NIFTY50.NSE had closed with a positive note on Monday with a Doji on daily chart but the momentum indicators are still showing strength which suggest that a Doji could have been just a pause to trend and not reversal. As we could notice in the chart, Index has been travelling into a upside channel since the low in mid-October and it seems to be sustaining without breaking out on either side. For today resistance on upside is at 18440 while support is at 18136 which can act as trailing SL to LONG positions. Though ultimate support where one should go short would be below 18050. To sum up, Hold your longs with trailing SL at 18136 and one can book some profits at 18440 while shorts can be initiated only if we close below 18050. Bullish",Bullish

Rahul Goud, Research Analyst - Equity Research of @CapitalViaGlobalResearch is of the view that When Adani Enterprises will be added to the Nifty50, the counter may see a net inflow of about $213 million, while Shree Cement would see an outflow of about $87 million. 
 
""Inclusion comes at a time when the group is 'seriously over leveraged,' and its numerous investments in capital-intensive sectors could present long-term dangers to investors. Analysts have noted pressure on the conglomerate's credit ratings and profits,"" Goud said. 
 
""Given its high valuation and significant group debt, we advise against purchasing the stock at the current price. In our experience, anytime a high-debt stock has been included in the Nifty50, that stock has lagged peers, and as a result of the inclusion, we may observe some impact on the Nifty50 returns in the years to come,"" said Goud.

Nifty seems to be running a lot these days if we look from the eyes of intraday traders but as positional traders, we are pretty much range bound. Since 22 August 2022, Nifty has been in the range of 17200-17700 which is just 3% range but seems alot looking at the volatility. But now this wait seems to be over with breakout expected on either side next week. I am biased that we may see a break down below the upside trending support line of recent rally which is at 17345 for the next week while more confirmation would be seen with Nifty breaking down below 17153 which is low of August month.

Simplified Reversal 
 
Nifty has been in dream rally since the low at 15191 on 17th June 2022 for almost 10 weeks but since last 2 sessions it has given some profit booking to 2800 points rally. There is a panic situation across the trader community with heavy sell-off! But i would like to warn that this might be just the beginning of some big pain ahead for long traders. Looking at some simple trading-rule of 5 day average (blue line) and 10 day average (red line) crossover, Nifty has for the first time yesterday after 27th June 2022, has closed below both the short term averages. As we could notice in the chart, until we close above 17720 this week, Nifty is going to be in downside momentum. So would suggest to book longs today if you havent yet for short term! Bearish",Bearish
$NIFTY50.NSE,"Why are short term traders so emotionally attached to long trades? When we got a rally for almost 2 months, from the low on 17th June to high on 18th august, market movement was cheered but just 2 days of correction and they feel its a false breakdown?

¬∑       Morgan Stanley's projection comes as Asia's third-largest economy grew 9.2% in the fiscal year 2022, a sharp recovery from a 6.6% contraction in the previous year as COVID-19 lockdowns took a severe toll on its economy.

In the domestic front, better than expected quarterly results, stable oil price and FIIs buying interest (FIIs buys Rs1000cr on Friday) will be positive sentiment in the markets. SGX Nifty is up by 40 points  while US Dow Future slipped over 100 points or 0.3%.

Key Points:
* Cars24 (1716847D IN) is one of India's leading used auto (primarily car) marketplace.  The company claims a 90% share in the online used car market. 
* Channel feedback suggests no customer loyalty and a poor competitive position compared to local unorganised sales yards.

There is little chance the US Fed will deviate from the expected 0.75% rate hike on the 27th. Markets will seek guidance  from Chair Jay Powell on September rate plans. Futures markets are betting that the Fed‚Äôs key interest rate will be 3% in Sep, implying a 0.75 rate increase.

Just follow the road on channel 
 
 
#Nifty has been volatile in recent days and also confusing for high beta traders but during such course it has formed an upside channel. If you could notice the lows on channel, they are also perfectly taking support at 5 and 10 DSMA  (red-blue line) on closing basis since the channel has been formed. Talking about indicators, RSI has been trending steady over 50 mark since last two sessions while MACD has given confirmation of long side momentum by trading above 0 level mark on the scale. So for traders, now its a simple strategy to follow the road on channel which means SL is at 16000 mark while targets on upside can be at at 16540/16780.

Breakout from channel on SGX Nifty 
 
Interestingly, today i was looking at SGX Nifty charts and spotted a downward sloping channel breakout on hourly charts. Breakout was at the level of 16125 today morning while it was also a move above 5hours SMA which was acting as strong resistance at same level yesterday. Another factor supporting bulls ride is that SGX Nifty has started travelling in upside channel already which has now resistance at 16171 above which a new rally would be initiated. Indicators on hourly chart are supporting bulls momentum too as RSI is charging above 50 mark while MACD is about to cross 0 line from negative territory to positive.  
 
So to sum up, Nifty is expected to stay bullish today but a small resistance is at 16171 above which we could see new highs on hourly chart. But i recommend to keep strict stop loss at 16090 on the downside for traders.

Today we are going have fun on D-street as markets are expected to open lower against the strong momentum we closed with yesterday which will intensify bull vs bears in opening minutes resulting to high volatility. Firstly, Nifty has strong support at 15940 of 5 Day SMA crossover 10 Day SMA which is also the trend line support breached recently to turnaround 3 months down trend. Secondly, FII has paused its selling in cash market which is a strong positive factor. Thirdly, Bank Nifty is showing sign of strong upmove. So in all traders should take a risk of going long today at any dip with SL of 15940 on spot levels.

* Financed emissions are investors' ""shares"" of investees' Scopes 1 and 2. A bit like someone else pulling the trigger, but being sent to the gallows for selling them the gun.
* Portfolio emissions are major source of climate-related financial risks, often ""hidden"" because  financed emissions are grossly under-reported (or, quite commonly, un-reported). Bearish",Bearish

Nifty finally breached 7 months old downside channel towards south which indicates more furious sell-off in coming weeks. Since last few weeks, 15900 was acting as a strong support on the indices but on Friday we have closed below the support indicating more weakness. So were would this carnage end for the bulls? The market always of probabilities in answer and so I have this time too. Checking on Elliot wave, I feel we are into corrective wave C which could end now either at 15450 (considering Wave A=Wave C) or at 14800 (considering  Wave C= 123.6% of Wave A).  Though chances of taking support at 15450 are brighter because it coincides with other EW guideline which states that corrective WAVE shouldn't trade below motive wave 1 which is 15431. Please note that its just a guideline and Nifty could even test the second possibility so trade accordingly.

Key Points:
* Delhivery is the largest and fastest-growing 3PL express parcel delivery player in India. It has cut its IPO raise from Rs74.6 billion ($1 billion) to Rs52.4 billion ($0.7 billion).
* In Delhivery IPO Initiation: Can It Deliver?, we noted that the fundamentals are mixed as it has been unable to leverage strong growth to deliver profits or cash generation.

""Several months ago, I discussed ESG aspects of the LIC IPO and promised an updated as the date drew closer, so here it is. Alas, no pre-IPO ESG ratings yet and no improvement in pre-IPO ESG messaging."" - Kyle Rudden

Key Points:
* Several months ago, I published two Insights addressing aspects of the impending IPO of Life Insurance Corporation of India (1248Z IN) from several specific ESG perspectives.
* More specifically, they addressed: 1) LIC's pursuit of pre-IPO ESG ratings, and 2) the decidedly weak (almost non-existent) ESG messaging in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus.
* I promised an update as the IPO drew closer. Unfortunately, no pre-IPO ESG ratings yet and the same generic pre-IPO message... but at this stage, none of that really matters. Bearish",Bearish
$NIFTY50.NSE,"$NIFTY50.NSE has been around in a range since last 10 trading sessions but during that it has respected 200 day average perfectly around 17200 level. It has closed at or below 200 day average for 9 sessions out of last 10 . For a technical breakout , its a guideline that we should sustain for two consecutive days on closing basis above breakout level for a confirmation and that is why that one day could be considered as false breakout. Yesterdays closing has been again way below 200 day average and volumes on future were comparatively higher which opens the gate for more downside. Considering Elliot Wave, we are into corrective wave and it seems we have completed Wave B yesterday at 17399 . Now we are into Wave C which could be equal in length of Wave A and we might see 1270 points correction from 17399 i.e., to 16150.

Nifty had been trading in a dream rally since the low at 15600 in Feb but now it seems near term high has been pinned at 18114. There are many technical factors supporting the view that we may play short from tomorrow. Firstly, Nifty has resisted exactly at larger degree channel line which is intact since the life at 18604  Secondly, Nifty has breached down channel which it was running onto since recent low at 15600. Thirdly, 15 day average (red line) where recent support was strong has been breached for last two trading sessions and Nifty has closed below the same to confirm the weakness. And lastly, RSI and MACD, both has shown bearish crossover on their respective averages. So to sum up, we can Freshly short nifty for a week with SL of 17685 while first target is at 200 day average at 17158 and second target would be open for new post. Bearish",Bearish

$NIFTY50.NSE,"Reasons for $NIFTY50.NSE $NIFTY100.NSE in a bear mode:

1. Weak global cues due sooner than expected Taper Tantrum. Due to more than expected rise in inflation rate, traders fear American and European Central bank to begin increasing interest rate sooner than expected. Same in India.

2. Crude Oil price is declining globally after US announced to open its emergency reserve to tackle rising inflation. It is harming the coffers of oil companies. As major oil & petroleum companies in India have a large share in nifty index, market is falling.

3. Failure of RIL-Armaco deal which made $RELIANCE.NSE price fall by 4.4% yesterday. Reliance have ~20% index share.

4. Farm laws being repealed. Shows weak political stability.

5. Rising covid cases in Europe

New Margin rules from 01-09-2021

SEBI margin rules explain in layman‚Äôs language:

SEBI has changed some rules related to margin and trading. 

1) Buying and selling of shares will Require Upfront margin from now onwards.

Eg: If you want to buy Reliance shares worth 1lakh, you must have 20k Rs in your account as cash and the rest money to be paid within 2 days...

üëÜüèª Major Change If you want to sell 1 lac worth of Reliance shares from your holdings for that scenario also you must have min 20k rs in your account. Failing which penalties will be levied.

üëÜüèª Read Carefully... Selling from holding will also require Upfront margin in cash (Var+ELM).

You can keep extra cash or can pledge other holdings for the stipulated margin required. Bearish",Bearish

$HINDUNILVR.NSE,"$HINDUNILVR.NSE dropped 2% after its Q4 results missed Street estimates. Volumes grew 4% over the previous year (vs estimate of 5%-6% growth). A slowdown in the rural market (-3% YoY) and weakness in the FMCG business were the main reasons behind the underperformance. Steep raw material costs plus muted consumer sentiment hurt operating margins. Here are the key stats: üìä

Revenue: Rs 14,893 cr; +11% YoY (vs Est: Rs 15,250 cr)
EBITDA: Rs 3,471 cr; +7% YoY (vs Est: Rs 3,650 cr)

Net Profit: Rs 2,552 cr; +10% YoY (vs Est: Rs 2,580 cr) 

Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and Managing Director at HUL said: 
The near-term operating environment is likely to remain volatile. With inflation easing due to lapping of high base and sequential softening in a few commodities, price and volume growths will rebalance. Market volumes will recover gradually as consumption habits readjust.

""The Rukus around Hindustan Unilever Limited's increase in royalty payments to its parent Unilever appears to be just Noise."" - Pranav Bhavsar (India Independent Insight)

Key Points:
* Hindustan Unilever (HUVR IN)'s strong quarterly performance was overshadowed by a proposed hike in royalty payments to parent Unilever PLC (ULVR LN) 
* HUVR's historical royalty growth has been below revenue and PBT growth and hence does not generate any red flags in terms of minority shareholder protection.  
* While the impact on EPS is ~3%, we believe much of the reaction around HUVR's Royalty is Noise.

$HINDUNILVR.NSE,"$HINDUNILVR.NSE Q3 results were good so what explains the sharp 4% drop in HUL‚Äôs stock price?

HUL, along with its Q3 results, approved increasing this royalty payment from 2.65% currently to 3.45% in phases over the next 3 years. This will have a direct impact on the company‚Äôs bottom line, which is a NEGATIVE! 

Domestic brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher estimates the hike in royalty charges will result in a 3% drop in earnings per share (EPS). The risk of another hike after 5 years (the previous contract was for 10 years starting Jan 2013) also hurt sentiment. Double yikes!! üëé Bearish",Bearish

* Presence across multiple price points and playing a targeted game in target geographies will aid in maintaining steady-state growth.

The Indian government's push towards a digital economy is driving the growth of the tech industry in India. According to reports, the Indian IT industry is to touch $300-350 billion in the next five years which is a significant jump from the $200 billion valuation in 2020. 
 
However, the Indian tech industry has also faced some challenges, particularly with regard to talent retention and skill development. 
 
Investors looking for exposure to the Indian tech industry may want to consider companies like $INFY.NSE, $TCS.NSE, and $HCLTECH.NSE, which have a long track record of success and are well-established in the industry. We have a BUY rating on these stocks currently, especially using dollar cost averaging.

The overall trend of the Nifty50 is bullish. This year, it is in a correction phase. Last month, it experienced a major support level of 16,900 and reversed back into positive sentiment. 
 
""One should keep a bullish view of the market. Nifty is expected to move up from the support zone of 16,900‚Äì17,000 with a stop loss of 16,640. On the higher side, 17,500 levels can be the next hurdle.

Bank Nifty has been also working in line with Nifty around 200 day SMA but interesting part on this was that it has been completely below the average for last 10 trading sessions. Strong earnings on ICICI Bank and Axis Bank didn't lead up the sector which shows that how strongly 200 day SMA is working as resistance. Now analyzing further move with Elliot wave then we have initiated our move on Wave C since the high point at 36718 and this move could end near to 33470 which is arrived by calculating it equally to Wave A from 38759-35511.  
 
P.S. Stop loss can be kept at 36950 which is 200 days SMA while reward is 2500+ points.

$NIFTYBANK.NSE  
 
Bank Nifty has been a outperformer in recent rally in last 6 months but now it seems it gonna break down from the channel too. Channel though is a downward sloping but if it breaks on downside then momentum and volatility will be fast and furious. One strong factor supporting my downside view is that Index has closed below 200 Day Average (Yellow line) for 6th Consecutive session which means weakness. Indicators i.e., MACD and RSI, have already shown bearish crossover of its average. Secondly, index is consecutively trading below short term moving averages 5 and 10 day SMA. So inshort if we break below 35506 then fresh shorts can be initiated. Target would be open while SL is at 200 day average 36940. Cheers! Bearish",Bearish

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)‚Äôs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept its policy rates and accommodative stance unchanged in today‚Äôs meeting. It held economic recovery post second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was still nascent and maintained that the shadow of rising inflation would pass. But its announcement of greater absorption of surplus liquidity through variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) operations could be read as the beginning of its imminent exit from unconventional monetary easing.

The RBI has reiterated its support to economic recovery as of now by maintaining low rates and conducive financial conditions. However, with growth expected to gain momentum in the second half of this fiscal, and inflation remaining elevated, we expect monetary policy to tighten in the coming months. The US Federal Reserve is also expected to begin tapering bond purchases by end-2021, further reducing scope for the RBI to continue its present policy stance. Bullish",Bullish

The overall trend of the Nifty50 is bullish. This year, it is in a correction phase. Last month, it experienced a major support level of 16,900 and reversed back into positive sentiment. 
 
""One should keep a bullish view of the market. Nifty is expected to move up from the support zone of 16,900‚Äì17,000 with a stop loss of 16,640. On the higher side, 17,500 levels can be the next hurdle. As per the MACD histogram, which is above the zero line with a positive crossover on daily charts, I expect positive momentum can be continued and we can see 17,700 levels this month,"" said Dongre.

Around 80% of Nifty constituents advanced this week while the top gainers were HDFC Life and Apollo Hospital. Nifty PSU Bank Index was the top sectoral gainer this week up 5% and Nifty IT continued its 4th consecutive positive streak.

üéØ The bulls were in total control triggered by a drop in crude prices, a falling dollar index, declining bond yields, and FII buying.
The Indian rupee closed at 81.67 against the dollar.

Bank Nifty has been also working in line with Nifty around 200 day SMA but interesting part on this was that it has been completely below the average for last 10 trading sessions. Strong earnings on ICICI Bank and Axis Bank didn't lead up the sector which shows that how strongly 200 day SMA is working as resistance. Now analyzing further move with Elliot wave then we have initiated our move on Wave C since the high point at 36718 and this move could end near to 33470 which is arrived by calculating it equally to Wave A from 38759-35511.  
 
P.S. Stop loss can be kept at 36950 which is 200 days SMA while reward is 2500+ points.

$NIFTYBANK.NSE  
 
Bank Nifty has been a outperformer in recent rally in last 6 months but now it seems it gonna break down from the channel too. Channel though is a downward sloping but if it breaks on downside then momentum and volatility will be fast and furious. One strong factor supporting my downside view is that Index has closed below 200 Day Average (Yellow line) for 6th Consecutive session which means weakness. Indicators i.e., MACD and RSI, have already shown bearish crossover of its average. Secondly, index is consecutively trading below short term moving averages 5 and 10 day SMA. So inshort if we break below 35506 then fresh shorts can be initiated. Target would be open while SL is at 200 day average 36940. Cheers! Bearish",Bearish

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)‚Äôs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept its policy rates and accommodative stance unchanged in today‚Äôs meeting. It held economic recovery post second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was still nascent and maintained that the shadow of rising inflation would pass. But its announcement of greater absorption of surplus liquidity through variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) operations could be read as the beginning of its imminent exit from unconventional monetary easing.

The RBI has reiterated its support to economic recovery as of now by maintaining low rates and conducive financial conditions. However, with growth expected to gain momentum in the second half of this fiscal, and inflation remaining elevated, we expect monetary policy to tighten in the coming months. The US Federal Reserve is also expected to begin tapering bond purchases by end-2021, further reducing scope for the RBI to continue its present policy stance. Bullish",Bullish
